Bitmap Compression

Program Description:
    This script will take a file and create an unsorted and sorted bitmap.
    Then, with each version, it will perform both 32 bit compression
    as well as 64 bit compression on both files.

    This script will only work on the animal doc as it needs to be formatted 
    in this specific way.

Run Program:
    To run program, use command:
    > python bitmapcomp.py

    If python 3 is not set as default, use command:
    > python3 bitmapcomp.py
